# TDD pairing interview procedure 

# 1. Provide this branch when conducting a mock pair programming session for the interview. 

# 2. Navigate the candidate to the skeleton UnOrderedSet.kt class then explain that he/she is 
#    to intemplement the methods in the skeleton class using the TDD methodology. 

# 3. Navigate the candidate to the UnOrderedSetTest.kt class informing him/her that the tests 
#    for the implementation should be written first in such a way as to fail due to the 
#    implementation not yet existing. 

#    Exampleâ€¦   Candidate begins by writing a test for the add method that fails. 
#               The candidate then writes the implementation and runs the test again. 
#               If it passes the candidate moves on to writing the next method continuing 
#               this pattern (red green refactor). If the test fails the candidate refactors 
#               until he/she can continue this development pattern.
